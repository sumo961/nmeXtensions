// LocationManagerDelegate: Based on the Locateme sample from Apple
// Modifications for NME extension made by Emiliano Angelini (emibap)

/*
     File: GetLocationViewController.m
 Abstract: Attempts to acquire a location measurement with a specific level of accuracy. A timeout is used to avoid wasting power in the case where a sufficiently accurate measurement cannot be acquired. Presents a SetupViewController instance so the user can configure the desired accuracy and timeout. Uses a LocationDetailViewController instance to drill down into details for a given location measurement.
