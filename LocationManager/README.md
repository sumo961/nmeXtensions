**Haxe NME LocationManager extension**

This is a native extension for haxe NME which allows to obtain the location (Latitude / Longitude) of a device.
(Currently iOS only)
If my free time allows it, my goal is to replicate the functionality of the [CLLocationManager][4] class.

**Usage**

Reference the extension in your .nmml:
	<include path="path/to/LocationManager/Extension" />

Reference the following iOS framework in your .nmml:

	<dependency name="CoreLocation.framework" if="ios" />

LocationManager works in the following way:

	After a startUpdatingLocation static call, the locationUpdate process begins and for every location update a callback is called.
	The callback comes with 2 location objects, one for the new location and another for the previous one.
		
	This is a list of all the properties of a Location Object:
		altitude:Float;
		latitude:Float;
		longitude:Float;
		course:Float;
		horizontalAccuracy:Float;
		speed:Float;
		timestamp:Float; (ms sin 1970)
		verticalAccuracy:Float;

	The process can be stopped by using the stopUpdatingLocation() static method. And if there's an error It will be notified by another callback.

Just call this static Methods to use it:
    
	LocationManager.startUpdatingLocation(locationUpdateCB:Dynamic, finishedUpdatingCB:Dynamic, errorCB:Dynamic)

	Parameters:
	-----------
	locationUpdateCB:Dynamic - A callback for each location update. Brings 2 location Dynamic parameters for the new and old Locations.
	finishedUpdatingCB:Dynamic - A callback that notifies when the location update has finished. Has a status String parameter.
	errorCB:Dynamic - A callback that reports an error. Has a status String parameter.

	LocationManager.stopUpdatingLocation();

**Running the test application**

    cd Project
    nme build LocationManagerSample.nmml ios
    
    or 
    nme update LocationManagerSample.nmml ios

	For the flash target a mailto: URL call is being used.

**Recompiling the extension**

    cd Extension/project
    haxelib run hxcpp Build.xml
    
    or
	haxelib run hxcpp Build.xml -Diphoneos
	haxelib run hxcpp Build.xml -Diphoneos -DHXCPP_ARMV7
	haxelib run hxcpp Build.xml -Diphonesim
	(depending on your target)

The extension includes a copy of some classes from Apple's [LocateMe sample][1] (see license information in the relevant files).
The sample code also uses the [haxemaps][2] library (see license information in the relevant files). Maps implementation by Tony Polinelli (http://touchmypixel.com)

**IMPORTANT**
If you use the sample code, dont't expect it to have the same functionality than a commercial GPS or Apple's Maps App.
This code simply returns location updates and marks them a the map. For a more accurate usage of the Location API you should read something like [this][3].
